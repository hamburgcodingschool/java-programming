#### JVM
Provides the environment for Java.

#### JRE
Contains JVM and a set of libraries for code execution. The JRE is where Java code runs in.

#### JDK
Contains JRE and development tools. These tools contain e.g. debugger and compiler. This is needed for programming.

#### Compiler
Takes `*.java` files and compiles them into `*.class` files (byte code). This byte code is what JVM can understand.

#### Class Loader
Loads the byte code into memory. Part of JRE.

#### Bytecode Verifyer
Verifies if byte code is valid for execution.

#### Interpreter
Reads byte code stream and executes the program.
